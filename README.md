# Wikipeek
**A small but useful script that lets you preview a linked Wikipedia article**

Install this Userscript in your browser (tested in Firefox and Chrome) and when you browse Wikipedia, a short preview will pop up when you hover
the cursor over links to other Wikipedia articles.

I didn't find another Userscript that did just this, so I decided to make it.

Wikipeek is still an early work in progress. It doesn't work with all types of Wiki hyperlinks, and cannot yet display article previews on pages that are re-directs.
