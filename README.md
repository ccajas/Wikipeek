# Wikipeek
**A small but useful script that lets you preview a linked Wikipedia article**

Install this Userscript in your browser (tested in Firefox and Chrome) and when you browse Wikipedia, a short preview will pop up when you hover
the cursor over links to other Wikipedia articles.

I didn't find another Userscript that did just this, so I decided to make one. I find it useful for getting the gist of other articles when encountering terms I'm not readily familiar with.

Wikipeek is still an early work in progress. Improvements are still being made, and some bugs have to be fixed (for example, non-Wiki hyperlinks should be ignored).
